# DS-Projects
Welcome to my Data Analytics Projects repository!

I am a beginner data analyst who uses Python Pandas for data preprocessing, data cleaning, data formatting, and visualization using Matplotlib. I also use SPSS for statistical analysis, statistical hypothesis testing, and statistical inference. My repository includes data analytics projects, research projects such as greenhouse gas emissions and factor analysis of academic performance.

In this repository, you will find various projects that showcase my skills and experience in data analysis. The projects range from data cleaning and preprocessing to advanced statistical analysis. I have included code and visualizations for each project to make it easy for you to understand and replicate the analysis.

Some of the key skills and tools that I use in my projects include:

Python Pandas for data preprocessing, data cleaning, data formatting, and visualization using Matplotlib
SPSS for statistical analysis, statistical hypothesis testing, and regression analysis
SQL for data management
Report writing and interpretation of the findings. I hope you enjoy browsing through my projects and find them useful. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
